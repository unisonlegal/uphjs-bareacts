# Panchayat Raj Act, 1947

U P ACT 026 OF 1947

07 December, 1947

An Act to establish and develop Local Self-Government in the rural areas of U.P.

Preamble. Whereas it is expedient to establish and develop Local Self-Government in the rural areas of U.P. and to make better provisions for village administration and development.

It is hereby enacted as follows:

**Prefatory Notes**. The following extract from the Statement of Objects and Reasons may be usefully noticed.

\1. The U.P. Village Panchayat Act of 1920 was passed with a view to assist in the administration of civil and criminal justice in the rural areas, and also to effect improvements in the sanitation and other common concerns of villages. It is now admitted on all hands that progress under the Act has been disappointing. This is not surprising because the Act suffered from certain inherent defects, chief of them being that the Panchayats constituted under it were not truly representative of popular opinion and their field of activity was very much restricted. Government have now brought forward a more comprehensive measure which is free from these defects and is designed to satisfy the growing aspirations of the people.

\2. The Bill seeks to establish Panchayats in all villages on wider popular basis. It gives power to them to levy taxes, manage their funds, make bye-laws, prepare their budgets and maintain and establish schools and dispensaries. It also contemplates the organization of a village volunteer corps for watch and ward and the creation of Adalati Panchayats distinct from Village Panchayats with more substantial powers relating to the administration of civil and criminal justice than are conferred at present. The chief aim of the Bill is to revitalize village corporate life and instil in the people the spirits of self-reliance and common endeavour to ameliorate their conditions without depending too much on Government vide U.P. Gazette, Extraordinary, 8th August, 1946.
