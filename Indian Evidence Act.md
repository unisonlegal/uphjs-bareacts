(_e_) _A_ is accused of a crime.

The facts that, either before, or at the time of, or after the alleged crime, _A_ provided evidence which would tend to give to the facts of the case an appearance favourable to himself, or that he destroyed or concealed evidence, or prevented the presence or procured the absence of persons who might have been witnesses, or suborned persons to give false evidence respecting it, are relevant.

(_f_) The question is, whether _A_ robbed _B_.

The fact that, soon after the alleged robbery, he made a complaint relating to the offence, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was made, are relevant.

Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which establish the identity of any thing or person whose identity is relevant, or fix the time or place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or which show the relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are necessary for that purpose.

Illustrations

(_b_) _A_ sues _B_ for a libel imputing disgraceful conduct to _A_; _B_ affirms that the matter alleged to be libellous is true.

The position and relations of the parties at the time when the libel was published may be relevant facts as introductory to the facts in issue.

(_c_) _A_ is accused of a crime.

The fact that, soon after the commission of the crime, _A_ absconded from his house, is relevant under Section 8, as conduct subsequent to and affected by facts in issue.

The fact that, at the time when he left home, he had sudden and urgent business at the place to which he went, is relevant, as tending to explain the fact that he left home suddenly.

The details of the business on which he left are not relevant, except in so far as they are necessary to show that the business was sudden and urgent.

(_d_) _A_ sues _B_ for inducing _C_ to break a contract of service made by him with _A. C_, on leaving _A_'s service, says to _A_ I am leaving you because _B_ has made me a better offer . This statement is a relevant fact as explanatory of _C_'s conduct, which is relevant as a fact in issue.

(_e_) _A_, accused of theft, is seen to give the stolen property to _B_, who is seen to give it to _A_'s wife. _B_ says as he delivers it _A_ says you are to hide this . _B_'s statement is relevant as explanatory of a fact which is part of the transaction.

(_f_) _A_ is tried for a riot and is proved to have marched at the head of a mob. The cries of the mob are relevant as explanatory of the nature of the transaction.

## Section 10. Things said or done by conspirator in reference to common design

Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference to their common intention, after the time when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.

Illustration

Reasonable ground exists for believing that _A_ has joined in a conspiracy to wage war against the [^26][Government of India].

The facts that _B_ procured arms in Europe for the purpose of the conspiracy, _C_ collected money in Calcutta for a like object, _D_ persuaded persons to join the conspiracy in Bombay, _E_ published writings advocating the object in view at Agra, and _F_ transmitted from Delhi to _G_ at Kabul the money which _C_ had collected at Calcutta, and the contents of a letter written by _H_ giving an account of the conspiracy, are each relevant, both to prove the existence of the conspiracy, and to prove _A_'s complicity in it, although he may have been ignorant of all of them, and although the persons by whom they were done were strangers to him, and although they may have taken place before he joined the conspiracy or after he left it.

## Section 11. When facts not otherwise relevant become relevant

Facts not otherwise relevant are relevant

(1) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact;

(2) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or non-existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable or improbable.

Illustrations

(_a_) The question is whether _A_ committed a crime at Calcutta on a certain day. The fact that, on that day, _A_ was at Lahore is relevant.

The fact that, near the time when the crime was committed, _A_ was at a distance from the place where it was committed, which would render it highly improbable, though not impossible, that he committed it, is relevant.

(_b_) The question is, whether _A_ committed a crime.

The circumstances are such that the crime must have been committed either by _A_, _B_, _C_ or _D_. Every fact which shows that the crime could have been committed by no one else, and that it was not committed by either _B_, _C_ or _D_, is relevant.

## Section 12. In suits for damages, facts tending to enable Court to determine amount are relevant

In suits in which damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the Court to determine the amount of damages which ought to be awarded, is relevant.

## Section 13. Facts relevant when right or custom is in question

Where the question is as to the existence of any right or custom, the following facts are relevant:

(_a_) any transaction by which the right or custom in question was created, claimed, modified, recognized, asserted or denied, or which was inconsistent with its existence;

(_b_) particular instances in which the right or custom was claimed, recognized or exercised, or in which its exercise was disputed, asserted or departed from.

Illustration

The question is whether _A_ has a right to a fishery. _A_ deed conferring the fishery on _A_'s ancestors, a mortgage of the fishery by _A_'s father, a subsequent grant of the fishery by _A_'s father, irreconcilable with the mortgage, particular instances in which _A_'s father exercised the right, or in which the exercise of the right was stopped by _A_'s neighbours, are relevant facts.

## Section 14. Facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body, or bodily feeling

Facts showing the existence of any state of mind, such as intention, knowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-will or good-will towards any particular person, or showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant, when the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant.

[^27][_Explanation 1_. A fact relevant as showing the existence of a relevant state of mind must show that the state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular matter in question.

_Explanation 2_. But where, upon the trial of a person accused of an offence, the previous commission by the accused of an offence is relevant within the meaning of this section, the previous conviction of such person shall also be a relevant fact.]

Illustrations

(_a_) _A_ is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. It is proved that he was in possession of a particular stolen article.

The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.

[^28][(_b_) _A_ is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit coin which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit.

The fact that, at the time of its delivery, _A_ was possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit coin is relevant.

The fact that _A_ had been previously convicted of delivering to another person as genuine a counterfeit coin knowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.]

(_c_) _A_ sues _B_ for damage done by a dog of _B_'s which _B_ knew to be ferocious.

The facts that the dog had previously bitten _X_, _Y_ and _Z_, and that they had made complaints to _B_, are relevant.

(_d_) The question is, whether _A_, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name of the payee was fictitious.

The fact that _A_ had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have been transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant, as showing that _A_ knew that the payee was a fictitious person.

(_e_) _A_ is accused of defaming _B_ by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of _B_.

The fact of previous publications by _A_ respecting _B_, showing ill-will on the part of _A_ towards _B_, is relevant, as proving _A_'s intention to harm _B_'s reputation by the particular publication in question.

The facts that there was no previous quarrel between _A_ and _B_, and that _A_ repeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing that _A_ did not intend to harm the reputation of _B_.

(_f_) _A_ is sued by _B_ for fraudulently representing to _B_ that _C_ was solvent, whereby _B_, being induced to trust _C_, who was insolvent, suffered loss.

The fact that at the time when _A_ represented _C_ to be solvent, _C_ was supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that _A_ made the representation in good faith.

(_g_) _A_ is sued by _B_ for the price of work done by _B_, upon a house of which _A_ is owner, by the order of _C_, a contractor.

_A_'s defence is that _B_'s contract was with _C_.

The fact that _A_ paid _C_ for the work in question is relevant, as proving that _A_ did, in good faith, make over to _C_ the management of the work in question, so that _C_ was in a position to contract with _B_ on _C_'s own account, and not as agent for _A_.

(_h_) _A_ is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found, and the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found.

The fact that public notice of the loss of the property had been given in the place where _A_ was, is relevant, as showing that _A_ did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found.

The fact that _A_ knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by _C_, who had heard of the loss of the property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant as showing that the fact that _A_ knew of the notice did not disprove _A_'s good faith.

(_i_) _A_ is charged with shooting at _B_ with intent to kill him. In order to show _A_'s intent, the fact of _A_'s having previously shot at _B_ may be proved.

(_j_) _A_ is charged with sending threatening letters to _B_. Threatening letters previously sent by _A_ to _B_ may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters.

(_k_) The question is, whether _A_ has been guilty of cruelty towards _B_, his wife.

Expressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty, are relevant facts.

(_l_) The question is, whether _A_'s death was caused by poison.

Statements made by _A_ during his illness as to his symptoms, are relevant facts.

(_m_) The question is, what was the state of _A_'s health at the time when an assurance on his life was effected.

Statements made by _A_ as to the state of his health at or near the time in question, are relevant facts.

(_n_) _A_ sues _B_ for negligence in providing him with a carriage for hire not reasonably fit for use, whereby _A_ was injured.

The fact that _B_'s attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular carriage, is relevant.

The fact that _B_ was habitually negligent about the carriages which he let to hire, is irrelevant.

(_o_) _A_ is tried for the murder of _B_ by intentionally shooting him dead.

The fact that _A_, on other occasions, shot at _B_ is relevant, as showing his intention to shoot _B_.

The fact that _A_ was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them, is irrelevant.

(_p_) _A_ is tried for a crime.

The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that particular crime, is relevant.

The fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to commit crimes of that class, is irrelevant.

## Section 15. Facts bearing on question whether act was accidental or intentional

When there is a question whether an act was accidental or intentional, [^29][or done with a particular knowledge or intention], the fact that such act formed part of a series of similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was concerned, is relevant.

Illustrations

(_a_) _A_ is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is insured.

The facts that _A_ lived in several houses successively, each of which he insured, in each of which fire occurred, and after each of which fires _A_ received payment from a different insurance office, are relevant, as tending to show that fires were not accidental.

(_b_) _A_ is employed to receive money from the debtors of _B_. It is _A_'s duty to make entries in a book showing the amounts received by him. He makes an entry showing that on a particular occasion he received less than he really did receive.

The question is, whether this false entry was accidental or intentional.

The facts that other entries made by _A_ in the same book are false, and that the false entry is in each case in favour of _A_, are relevant.

(_c_) _A_ is accused of fraudulently delivering to _B_ a counterfeit rupee. The question is, whether the delivery of the rupee was accidental.

The fact that, soon before or soon after the delivery to _B_, _A_ delivered counterfeit rupees to _C_, _D_ and _E_ are relevant, as showing that the delivery to _B_ was not accidental.

## Section 16. Existence of course of business when relevant

When there is a question whether a particular act was done, the existence of any course of business, according to which it naturally would have been done, is a relevant fact.

Illustrations

(_a_) The question is, whether a particular letter was despatched.

The facts that it was the ordinary course of business for all letters put in a certain place to be carried to the post, and that that particular letter was put in that place, are relevant.

(_b_) The question is, whether a particular letter reached _A_. The facts that it was posted in due course, and was not returned through the Dead Letter Office, are relevant.

Admissions

## Section 17. Admission defined

An admission is a statement, oral or documentary [^30][or contained in electronic form], which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons, and under the circumstances, hereinafter mentioned.

## Section 18. Admission by party to proceeding or his agent; by suitor in representative character; by party interested in subject-matter; by person from whom interest derived

Statements made by a party to the proceeding, or by an agent to any such party, whom the Court regards, under the circumstances of the case, as expressly or impliedly authorised by him to make them, are admissions.

Statements made by parties to suits, suing or sued in a representative character, are not admissions, unless they were made while the party making them held that character.

Statements made by

(1) persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary interest in the subject-matter of the proceeding, and who make the statement in their character of persons so interested, or

(2) persons from whom the parties to the suit have derived their interest in the subject-matter of the suit,

are admissions, if they are made during the continuance of the interest of the persons making the statements.

## Section 19. Admissions by persons whose position must be proved as against party to suit

Statements made by persons whose position or liability it is necessary to prove as against any party to the suit, are admissions, if such statements would be relevant as against such persons in relation to such position or liability in a suit brought by or against them, and if they are made whilst the person making them occupies such position or is subject to such liability.

Illustration

_A_ undertakes to collect rents for _B_.

_B_ sues _A_ for not collecting rent due from _C_ to _B_.

_A_ denies that rent was due from _C_ to _B_.

_A_ statement by _C_ that he owed _B_ rent is an admission, and is a relevant fact as against _A_, if _A_ denies that _C_ did owe rent to _B_.

## Section 20. Admissions by persons expressly referred to by party to suit

Statements made by persons to whom a party to the suit has expressly referred for information in reference to a matter in dispute are admissions.

Illustration

The question is, whether a horse sold by _A_ to _B_ is sound.

_A_ says to _B_ Go and ask _C_, _C_ knows all about it. _C_'s statement is an admission.

## Section 21. Proof of admissions against persons making them, and by or on their behalf

Admissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them, or his representative in interest; but they cannot be proved by or on behalf of the person who makes them or by his representative in interest, except in the following cases:

(1) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it is of such a nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as between third persons under Section 32.

(2) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it consists of a statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in issue, made at or about the time when such state of mind or body existed, and is accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood improbable.

(3) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is relevant otherwise than as an admission.

Illustrations

(_a_) The question between _A_ and _B_ is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged. _A_ affirms that it is genuine, _B_ that it is forged.

_A_ may prove a statement by _B_ that the deed is genuine, and _B_ may prove a statement by _A_ that the deed is forged; but _A_ cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can _B_ prove a statement by himself that the deed is forged.

(_b_) _A_, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away.

Evidence is given to show that the ship was taken out of her proper course.

_A_ produces a book kept by him in the ordinary course of his business, showing observations alleged to have been taken by him from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken out of her proper course. _A_ may prove these statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were dead, under Section 32, clause (2).

(_c_) _A_ is accused of a crime committed by him at Calcutta.

He produces a letter written by himself and dated at Lahore on that day, and bearing the Lahore post-mark of that day.

The statement in the date of the letter is admissible, because if _A_ were dead, it would be admissible under Section 32, clause (2).

(_d_) _A_ is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen.

He offers to prove that he refused to sell them below their value.

_A_ may prove these statements, though they are admissions, because they are explanatory of conduct influenced by facts in issue.

(_e_) _A_ is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit coin which he knew to be counterfeit.

He offers to prove that he asked a skilful person to examine the coin, as he doubted whether it was counterfeit or not, and that that person did examine it and told him it was genuine.

_A_ may prove these facts for the reasons stated in the last preceding illustration.

## Section 22. When oral admissions as to contents of documents are relevant

Oral admissions as to the contents of a document are not relevant, unless and until the party proposing to prove them shows that he is entitled to give secondary evidence of the contents of such document under the rules hereinafter contained, or unless the genuineness of a document produced is in question.

[^31][**22-A. When oral admission as to contents of electronic records are relevant**. Oral admissions as to the contents of electronic records are not relevant, unless the genuineness of the electronic record produced is in question.]

## Section 23. Admissions in civil cases, when relevant

In civil cases no admission is relevant, if it is made either upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under circumstances from which the Court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.

_Explanation_. Nothing in this section shall be taken to exempt any barrister, pleader, attorney or vakil from giving evidence of any matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under Section 126.

## Section 24. Confession caused by inducement, threat or promise, when irrelevant in criminal proceeding

A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if the making of the confession appears to the Court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise[^32], having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

## Section 25. Confession to police officer not to be proved

No confession made to a police officer[^33], shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence.

## Section 26. Confession by accused while in custody of police not to be proved against him

No confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it be made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate,[^34] shall be proved as against such person.

[^35][_Explanation_. In this section Magistrate does not include the head of a village discharging magisterial functions in the Presidency of Fort St. George [^36][* * *] or elsewhere, unless such headman is a Magistrate exercising the powers of a Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1882 (10 of 1882)[^37].]

## Section 27. How much of information received from accused may be proved

Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved.

## Section 28. Confession made after removal of impression caused by inducement, threat or promise, relevant

If such a confession as is referred to in Section 24 is made after the impression caused by any such inducement, threat or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been fully removed, it is relevant.

## Section 29. Confession otherwise relevant not to become irrelevant because of promise of secrecy, etc

If such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not become irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such confession, and that evidence of it might be given against him.

## Section 30. Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and others jointly under trial for same offence

When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the Court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.

[^38][_Explanation_. Offence as used in this section, includes the abetment of, or attempt to commit, the offence.[^39]]

Illustrations

(_a_) _A_ and _B_ are jointly tried for the murder of _C_. It is proved that _A_ said _B_ and I murdered _C_ . The Court may consider the effect of this confession as against _B_.

(_b_) _A_ is on his trial for the murder of _C_. There is evidence to show that _C_ was murdered by _A_ and _B_, and that _B_ said _A_ and I murdered _C_ .

This statement may not be taken into consideration by the Court against _A_, as _B_ is not being jointly tried.

## Section 31. Admissions not conclusive proof, but may estop

Admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted but they may operate as estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained.

Statements by Persons who cannot be called as Witnesses

## Section 32. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant

Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:

When the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business, or in the discharge of professional duty; or of an acknowledgment written or signed by him of the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind; or of a document used in commerce written or signed by him; or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him.

(3) **Or against interest of maker**. When the statement is against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the person making it, or when, if true, it would expose him or would have exposed him to a criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages.

(4) **Or gives opinion as to public right or custom, or matters of general interest**. When the statement gives the opinion of any such person, as to the existence of any public right or custom or matter of public or general interest, of the existence of which, if it existed, he would have been likely to be aware, and when such statement was made before any controversy as to such right, custom or matter had arisen.

(5) **Or relates to existence of relationship**. When the statement relates to the existence of any relationship [^40][by blood, marriage or adoption] between persons as to whose relationship [^41][by blood, marriage or adoption] the person making the statement had special means of knowledge, and when the statement was made before the question in dispute was raised.

(6) **Or is made in will or deed relating to family affairs**. When the statement relates to the existence of any relationship [^42][by blood, marriage or adoption] between persons deceased, and is made in any will or deed relating to the affairs of the family to which any such deceased person belonged, or in any family pedigree, or upon any tombstone, family portrait or other thing on which such statements are usually made, and when such statement was made before the question in dispute was raised.

(7) **Or in document relating to transaction mentioned in Section 13, clause (\*a\*)**. When the statement is contained in any deed, will or other document which relates to any such transaction as is mentioned in Section 13, clause (_a_).

**34.** [^43]**[Entries in books of account, including those maintained in an electronic form] when relevant**. [^44][Entries in the books of account, including those maintained in an electronic form], regularly kept in the course of business, are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the Court has to inquire, but such statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability.

Illustration

_A_ sues _B_ for Rs 1000 and shows entries in his account books showing _B_ to be indebted to him to this amount. The entries are relevant, but are not sufficient, without other evidence to prove the debt.

## Section 35. Relevancy of entry in public record

**35. Relevancy of entry in public record** [^45]**[or an electronic record], made in performance of duty**. An entry in any public or other official book, register or record [^46][or an electronic record], stating a fact in issue or relevant fact, and made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law of the country in which such book, register or record [^47][or an electronic record] is kept, is itself a relevant fact.

Judgments of courts of justice when relevant

## Section 40. Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial

The existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any Court from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial, is a relevant fact when the question is whether such Court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial.

## Section 41. Relevancy of certain judgments in probate, etc., jurisdiction

A final judgment, order or decree of a competent Court, in the exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction, which confers upon or takes away from any person any legal character, or which declares any person to be entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any specific thing, not as against any specified person but absolutely, is relevant when the existence of any such legal character, or the title of any such person to any such thing, is relevant.

Such judgment, order or decree is conclusive proof

that any legal character which it confers accrued at the time when such judgment, order or decree came into operation;

that any legal character, to which it declares any such person to be entitled, accrued to that person at the time when such judgment, [^55][order or decree] declares it to have accrued to that person;

that any legal character which it takes away from any such person ceased at the time from which such judgment, [^56][order or decree] declared that it had ceased or should cease;

and that anything to which it declares any person to be so entitled was the property of that person at the time from which such judgment, [^57][order or decree] declares that it had been or should be his property.

Judgments, orders or decrees other than those mentioned in Section 41, are relevant if they relate to matters of a public nature relevant to the enquiry; but such judgments, orders or decrees are not conclusive proof of that which they state.

Illustration

_A_ sues _B_ for trespass on his land. _B_ alleges the existence of a public right of way over the land, which _A_ denies.

The existence of a decree in favour of the defendant, in a suit by _A_ against _C_ for a trespass on the same land, in which _C_ alleged the existence of the same right of way, is relevant, but it is not conclusive proof that the right of way exists.

## Section 43. Judgments, etc., other than those mentioned in Sections 40 to 42, when relevant

Judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in Sections 40, 41 and 42, are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree, is a fact in issue, or is relevant under some other provision of this Act.

Illustrations

(_a_) _A_ and _B_ separately sue _C_ for a libel which reflects upon each of them. _C_ in each case says that the matter alleged to be libellous is true, and the circumstances are such that it is probably true in each case, or in neither.

_A_ obtains a decree against _C_ for damages on the ground that _C_ failed to make out his justification. The fact is irrelevant as between _B_ and _C_.

(_b_) _A_ prosecutes _B_ for adultery with _C_, _A_'s wife.

_B_ denies that _C_ is _A_'s wife, but the Court convicts _B_ of adultery.

Afterwards, _C_ is prosecuted for bigamy in marrying _B_ during _A_'s lifetime. _C_ says that she never was _A_'s wife.

The judgment against _B_ is irrelevant as against _C_.

(_c_) _A_ prosecutes _B_ for stealing a cow from him. _B_ is convicted.

_A_, afterwards, sues _C_ for the cow, which _B_ had sold to him before his conviction. As between _A_ and _C_, the judgment against _B_ is irrelevant.

(_d_) _A_ has obtained a decree for the possession of land against _B. C_, _B_'s son, murders _A_ in consequence.

The existence of the judgment is relevant, as showing motive for a crime.

[^58][(_e_) _A_ is charged with theft and with having been previously convicted of theft. The previous conviction is relevant, as a fact-in-issue.

(_f_) _A_ is tried for the murder of _B_. The fact that _B_ prosecuted _A_ for libel and that _A_ was convicted and sentenced is relevant under Section 8 as showing the motive for the fact-in-issue.]

## Section 44. Fraud or collusion in obtaining judgment, or incompetency of Court, may be proved

Any party to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment, order or decree which is relevant under Section 40, 41 or 42, and which has been proved by the adverse party, was delivered by a Court not competent to deliver it, or was obtained by fraud or collusion.

Opinions of third persons, when relevant

## Section 45. Opinions of experts

When the Court has to form an opinion upon a point of foreign law, or of science, or art, or as to identity of handwriting [^59][or finger impressions], the opinions upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science or art, [^60][or in questions as to identity of handwriting] [^61][or finger impressions] are relevant facts.

Such persons are called experts.

Illustrations

(_a_) The question is, whether the death of A was caused by poison.

The opinions of experts as to the symptoms produced by the poison by which A is supposed to have died, are relevant.

(_b_) The question is, whether A, at the time of doing a certain act, was, by reason of unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he was doing what was either wrong or contrary to law.

The opinions of experts upon the question whether the symptoms exhibited by A commonly show unsoundness of mind, and whether such unsoundness of mind usually renders persons incapable of knowing the nature of the acts which they do, or of knowing that what they do is either wrong or contrary to law, are relevant.

(_c_) The question is, whether a certain document was written by A. Another document is produced which is proved or admitted to have been written by A.

The opinions of experts on the question whether the two documents were written by the same person or by different persons, are relevant.

[^62][**45-A. Opinion of Examiner of Electronic Evidence**. When in a proceeding, the court has to form an opinion on any matter relating to any information transmitted or stored in any computer resource or any other electronic or digital form, the opinion of the Examiner of Electronic Evidence referred to in Section 79-A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000), is a relevant fact.

_Explanation_. For the purposes of this section, an Examiner of Electronic Evidence shall be an expert.]

## Section 46. Facts bearing upon opinions of experts

Facts, not otherwise relevant, are relevant if they support or are inconsistent with the opinions of experts, when such opinions are relevant.

Illustrations

## Section 47. Opinion as to handwriting, when relevant

When the Court has to form an opinion as to the person by whom any document was written or signed, the opinion of any person acquainted with the handwriting of the person by whom it is supposed to be written or signed that it was or was not written or signed by that person, is a relevant fact.

_Explanation_. A person is said to be acquainted with the handwriting of another person when he has seen that person write, or when he has received documents purporting to be written by that person in answer to documents written by himself or under his authority and addressed to that person, or when, in the ordinary course of business, documents purporting to be written by that person have been habitually submitted to him.

Illustration

The question is, whether a given letter is in the handwriting of _A_, a merchant in London.

_B_ is a merchant in Calcutta, who has written letters addressed to A and received letters purporting to be written by him. _C_ is _B_'s clerk, whose duty it was to examine and file _B_'s correspondence. _D_ is _B_'s broker, to whom _B_ habitually submitted the letters purporting to be written by _A_ for the purpose of advising with him thereon.

The opinions of _B_, _C_ and _D_ on the question whether the letter is in the handwriting of A are relevant, though neither _B_, _C_ nor _D_ ever saw _A_ write.

[^63][**47-A. Opinion as to** [^64]**[electronic signature] when relevant**. When the Court has to form an opinion as to the [^65][electronic signature] of any person, the opinion of the Certifying Authority which has issued the [^66][Electronic Signature Certificate] is a relevant fact.]

## Section 48. Opinion as to existence of right or custom, when relevant

When the Court has to form an opinion as to the existence of any general custom or right, the opinions, as to the existence of such custom or right, of persons who would be likely to know of its existence if it existed, are relevant.

_Explanation_. The expression general custom or right includes customs or rights common to any considerable class of persons.

Illustration

The right of the villagers of a particular village to use the water of a particular well is a general right within the meaning of this section.

## Section 49. Opinions as to usages, tenets, etc., when relevant

When the Court has to form an opinion as to

the usages and tenets of any body of men or family,

the constitution and government of any religious or charitable foundation, or

the meaning of words or terms used in particular districts or by particular classes of people,

the opinions of persons having special means of knowledge thereon, are relevant facts.

## Section 50. Opinion on relationship, when relevant

When the Court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such relationship, of any person who, as a member of the family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant fact:

Provided that such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage in proceedings under the Indian Divorce Act (4 of 1869), or in prosecutions under Sections 494, 495, 497 or 498 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).

Illustrations

(_a_) The question is, whether _A_ and _B_ were married.

The fact that they were usually received and treated by their friends as husband and wife, is relevant.

## Section 51. Grounds of opinion, when relevant

Whenever the opinion of any living person is relevant, the grounds on which such opinion is based are also relevant.

Illustration

An expert may give an account of experiments performed by him for the purpose of forming his opinion.

Character when relevant

## Section 52. In civil cases character to prove conduct imputed, irrelevant

In civil cases the fact that the character of any person concerned is such as to render probable or improbable any conduct imputed to him is irrelevant, except in so far as such character appears from facts otherwise relevant.

## Section 53. In criminal cases, previous good character relevant

In criminal proceedings, the fact that the person accused is of a good character, is relevant.

[^67][**53-A. Evidence of character or previous sexual experience not relevant in certain cases**. In a prosecution for an offence under Section 354, Section 354-A, Section 354-B, Section 354-C, Section 354-D, Section 376, [^68][Section 376-A, Section 376-AB, Section 376-B, Section 376-C, Section 376-D, Section 376-DA, Section 376-DB] or Section 376-E of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or for attempt to commit any such offence, where the question of consent is in issue, evidence of the character of the victim or of such person's previous sexual experience with any person shall not be relevant on the issue of such consent or the quality of consent.]

## Section 54. Previous bad character not relevant, except in reply

[^69][In criminal proceedings the fact that the accused person has a bad character is irrelevant, unless evidence has been given that he has a good character, in which case it becomes relevant.

_Explanation 1_. This section does not apply to cases in which the bad character of any person is itself a fact in issue.

_Explanation 2_. A previous conviction is relevant as evidence of bad character.]

## Section 55. Character as affecting damages

In civil cases, the fact that the character of any person is such as to affect the amount of damages which he ought to receive, is relevant.

_Explanation_. In Sections 52, 53, 54 and 55, the word character includes both reputation and disposition; but [^70][except as provided in Section 54], evidence may be given only of general reputation and general disposition, and not of particular acts by which reputation or disposition were shown.

Provided also that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other than a document, the Court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its inspection.

Chapter V

OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

## Section 61. Proof of contents of documents

The contents of documents may be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence.

## Section 62. Primary evidence

Primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of the court.

_Explanation 1_. Where a document is executed in several parts, each part is primary evidence of the document.

Where a document is executed in counterpart, each counterpart being executed by one or some of the parties only, each counterpart is primary evidence as against the parties executing it.

_Explanation 2_. Where a number of documents are all made by one uniform process, as in the case of printing, lithography, or photography, each is primary evidence of the contents of the rest; but where they are all copies of a common original, they are not primary evidence of the contents of the original.

Illustration

A person is shown to have been in possession of a number of placards, all printed at one time from one original. Any one of the placards is primary evidence of the contents of any other, but no one of them is primary evidence of the contents of the original.

## Section 63. Secondary evidence

Secondary evidence means and includes

(1) certified copies given under the provisions hereinafter contained[^90];

(2) copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in themselves insure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such copies;

(3) copies made from or compared with the original;

(4) counterparts of documents as against the parties who did not execute them;

(5) oral accounts of the contents of a document given by some person who has himself seen it.

Illustrations

(_a_) A photograph of an original is secondary evidence of its contents, though the two have not been compared, if it is proved that the thing photographed was the original.

(_b_) A copy compared with a copy of a letter made by a copying machine is secondary evidence of the contents of the letter, if it is shown that the copy made by the copying machine was made from the original.

(_c_) A copy transcribed from a copy, but afterwards compared with the original, is secondary evidence; but the copy not so compared is not secondary evidence of the original, although the copy from which it was transcribed was compared with the original.

(_d_) Neither an oral account of a copy compared with the original, nor an oral account of a photograph or machine-copy of the original, is secondary evidence of the original.

## Section 64. Proof of documents by primary evidence

Documents must be proved by primary evidence except in the cases hereinafter mentioned.

## Section 65. Cases in which secondary evidence relating to documents may be given

Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document in the following cases

(_a_) when the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power

of the person against whom the document is sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the Court, or

of any person legally bound to produce it,

and when, after the notice mentioned in Section 66, such person does not produce it;

(_b_) when the existence, condition or contents of the original have been proved to be admitted in writing by the person against whom it is proved or by his representative in interest;

(_c_) when the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable time;

(_d_) when the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable;

(_e_) when the original is a public document within the meaning of Section 74;

(_f_) when the original is a document of which a certified copy is permitted by this Act, or by any other law in force in [^91][India], to be given in evidence;[^92]

(_g_) when the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in Court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collection.

In cases (_a_), (_c_) and (_d_), any secondary evidence of the contents of the document is admissible.

In case (_b_), the written admission is admissible.

In case (_e_) or (_f_), a certified copy of the document, but no other kind of secondary evidence, is admissible.

In case (_g_), evidence may be given as to the general result of the documents by any person who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.

(_b_) _A_ sues _B_ for money due on a bond.

The execution of the bond is admitted, but _B_ says that it was obtained by fraud, which _A_ denies. If no evidence were given on either side, _A_ would succeed, as the bond is not disputed and the fraud is not proved.

Therefore the burden of proof is on _B_.

_Explanation_. The obligation stated in this section continues after the employment has ceased.

Illustrations

An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.

## Section 134. Number of witnesses

No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact.

Chapter X

OF THE EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES

## Section 135. Order of production and examination of witnesses

The order in which witnesses are produced and examined shall be regulated by the law and practice for the time being relating to civil and criminal procedure respectively, and, in the absence of any such law, by the discretion of the Court.

## Section 136. Judge to decide as to admissibility of evidence

When either party proposes to give evidence of any fact, the Judge may ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact, if proved, would be relevant; and the Judge shall admit the evidence if he thinks that the fact, if proved, would be relevant, and not otherwise.

If the fact proposed to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon proof of some other fact, such last-mentioned fact must be proved before evidence is given of the fact first mentioned, unless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact and the Court is satisfied with such undertaking.

If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being first proved, the Judge may, in his discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given before the second fact is proved, or require evidence to be given of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact.

Illustrations

(_a_) It is proposed to prove a statement about a relevant fact by a person alleged to be dead, which statement is relevant under Section 32.

The fact that the person is dead must be proved by the person proposing to prove the statement, before evidence is given of the statement.

(_b_) It is proposed to prove, by a copy, the contents of a document said to be lost.

The fact that the original is lost must be proved by the person proposing to produce the copy, before the copy is produced.

(_c_) _A_ is accused of receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen.

It is proposed to prove that he denied the possession of the property.

The relevancy of the denial depends on the identity of the property. The Court may, in its discretion, either require the property to be identified before the denial of the possession is proved, or permit the denial of the possession to be proved before the property is identified.

(_d_) It is proposed to prove a fact (_A_) which is said to have been the cause or effect of a fact in issue. There are several intermediate facts (_B_, _C_ and _D_) which must be shown to exist before the fact (_A_) can be regarded as the cause or effect of the fact in issue. The Court may either permit _A_ to be proved before _B_, _C_ or _D_ is proved, or may require proof of _B_, _C_ and _D_ before permitting proof of _A_.

## Section 137. Examination-in-chief

The examination of a witness by the party who calls him shall be called his examination-in-chief.

**Cross-examination**. The examination of a witness by the adverse party shall be called his cross-examination.

**Re-examination**. The examination of a witness, subsequent to the cross-examination by the party who called him, shall be called his re-examination.

## Section 138. Order of examinations

Witnesses shall be first examined-in chief then (if the adverse party so desires) cross-examined, then (if the party calling him so desires) re-examined.

The examination and cross-examination must relate to relevant facts but the cross-examination need not be confined to the facts to which the witness testified on his examination-in-chief.

**Direction of re-examination**. The re-examination shall be directed to the explanation of matters referred to in cross-examination; and if new matter is, by permission of the Court, introduced in re-examination, the adverse party may further cross-examine upon that matter.

## Section 139. Cross-examination of person called to produce a document

A person summoned to produce a document does not become a witness by the mere fact that he produces it, and cannot be cross-examined unless and until he is called as a witness.

## Section 140. Witnesses to character

Witnesses to character may be cross-examined and re-examined.

## Section 141. Leading questions

Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or expects to receive, is called a leading question.

## Section 142. When they must not be asked

Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in an examination-in-chief, or in a re-examination, except with the permission of the Court.

The Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed, or which have, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved.

## Section 143. When they may be asked

Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination.

## Section 144. Evidence as to matters in writing

Any witness may be asked, whilst under examination, whether any contract, grant or other disposition of property, as to which he is giving evidence, was not contained in a document, and if he says that it was, or if he is about to make any statement as to the contents of any document, which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to be produced, the adverse party may object to such evidence being given until such document is produced, or until facts have been proved which entitle the party who called the witness to give secondary evidence of it.

_Explanation_. A witness may give oral evidence of statements made by other persons about the contents of documents if such statements are in themselves relevant facts.

Illustration

The question is, whether _A_ assaulted _B_.

_C_ deposes that he heard _A_ say to _D_ _B_ wrote a letter accusing me of theft, and I will be revenged on him . This statement is relevant, as showing _A_'s motive for the assault, and evidence may be given of it, though no other evidence is given about the letter.

## [^175]**145. Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing**.

A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question, without such writing being shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.

## **146. Questions lawful in cross-examination**.

When a witness is cross-examined, he may, in addition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend

(1) to test his veracity,

(2) to discover who he is and what is his position in life, or

(3) to shake his credit, by injuring his character, although the answer to such questions might tend directly or indirectly to criminate him, or might expose or tend directly or indirectly to expose him to a penalty or forfeiture:

[^176][Provided that in a prosecution for an offence under Section 376, [^177][Section 376-A, Section 376-AB, Section 376-B, Section 376-C, Section 376-D, Section 376-DA, Section 376-DB] or Section 376-E of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or for attempt to commit any such offence, where the question of consent is an issue, it shall not be permissible to adduce evidence or to put questions in the cross-examination of the victim as to the general immoral character, or previous sexual experience, of such victim with any person for proving such consent or the quality of consent.]

## **147. When witness to be compelled to answer**.

If any such question relates to a matter relevant to the suit or proceeding, the provisions of Section 132 shall apply thereto.

## **148. Court to decide when question shall be asked and when witness compelled to answer**.

If any such question relates to a matter not relevant to the suit or proceeding, except insofar as it affects the credit of the witness by injuring his character, the court shall decide whether or not the witness shall be compelled to answer it, and may, if it thinks fit, warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer it. In exercising its discretion, the Court shall have regard to the following considerations

(1) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the Court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies;

(2) such questions are improper if the imputation which they convey relates to matters so remote in time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would not affect, or would affect in a slight degree, the opinion of the Court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies;

(3) such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the importance of the imputation made against the witness's character and the importance of his evidence;

(4) the Court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the witness's refusal to answer, the inference that the answer if given would be unfavourable.

## **149. Question not to be asked without reasonable grounds**.

No such question as is referred to in Section 148 ought to be asked, unless the person asking it has reasonable grounds for thinking that the imputation which it conveys is well-founded.

Illustrations

(_a_) A barrister is instructed by an attorney or vakil that an important witness is a dakait. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dakait.

(_b_) A pleader is informed by a person in Court that an important witness is a dakait. The informant, on being questioned by the pleader, gives satisfactory reasons for his statement. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dakait.

(_c_) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, is asked at random whether he is a dakait. There are here no reasonable grounds for the question.

(_d_) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, being questioned as to his mode of life and means of living, gives unsatisfactory answers. This may be a reasonable ground for asking him if he is a dakait.

## **150. Procedure of Court in case of question being asked without reasonable grounds**.

If the Court is of opinion that any such question was asked without reasonable grounds, it may, if it was asked by any barrister, pleader, vakil or attorney, report the circumstances of the case to the High Court or other authority to which such barrister, pleader, vakil or attorney is subject in the exercise of his profession.

## **151. Indecent and scandalous questions**.

The Court may forbid any questions or inquiries which it regards as indecent or scandalous, although such questions or inquiries may have some bearing on the questions before the Court unless they relate to facts in issue, or to matters necessary to be known in order to determine whether or not the facts in issue existed.

## **152. Questions intended to insult or annoy**.

The Court shall forbid any question which appears to it to be intended to insult or annoy, or which, though proper in itself, appears to the Court needlessly offensive in form.

## **153. Exclusion of evidence to contradict answers to questions testing veracity**.

When a witness has been asked and has answered any question which is relevant to the inquiry only insofar as it tends to shake his credit by injuring his character, no evidence shall be given to contradict him; but if he answers falsely, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence.

_Exception 1_. If a witness is asked whether he has been previously convicted of any crime and denies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction.

_Exception 2_. If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality, and answers it by denying the facts suggested, he may be contradicted.

Illustrations

(_a_) A claim against an underwriter is resisted on the ground of fraud.

The claimant is asked whether, in a former transaction, he had not made a fraudulent claim. He denies it.

Evidence is offered to show that he did make such a claim.

The evidence is inadmissible.

(_b_) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed from a situation for dishonesty. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that he was dismissed for dishonesty.

The evidence is not admissible.

(_c_) _A_ affirms that on a certain day he saw _B_ at Lahore.

_A_ is asked whether he himself was not on that day at Calcutta. He denies it.

Evidence is offered to show that _A_ was on that day at Calcutta.

The evidence is admissible, not as contradicting _A_ on a fact which affects his credit, but as contradicting the alleged fact that _B_ was seen on the day in question at Lahore.

In each of these cases the witness might, if his denial was false, be charged with giving false evidence.

(_d_) _A_ is asked whether his family has not had a blood feud with the family of _B_ against whom he gives evidence.

He denies it. He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach his impartiality.

**154. Question by party to his own witness**. [^178][(1)] The Court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party.

[^179][(2) Nothing in this section shall disentitle the person so permitted under sub-section (1), to rely on any part of the evidence of such witness.]

**155. Impeaching credit of witness**. The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls him

(1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit;

(2) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has [^180][accepted] the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;

(3) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.

(4) [^181][* * *]

_Explanation_. A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may not, upon his examination-in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked his reasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot be contradicted, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with giving false evidence.

Illustrations

(_a_) _A_ sues _B_ for the price of goods sold and delivered to _B. C_ says that he delivered the goods to _B_. Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, he said that he had not delivered the goods to _B_.

The evidence is admissible.

(_b_) _A_ is indicted for the murder of _B_.

_C_ says that _B_, when dying, declared that _A_ had given _B_ the wound of which he died.

Evidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, _C_ said that the wound was not given by _A_ or in his presence.

The evidence is admissible.

**156. Questions tending to corroborate evidence of relevant fact, admissible**. When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence of any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred, if the Court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies.

Illustration

_A_, an accomplice, gives an account of a robbery in which he took part. He describes various incidents unconnected with the robbery which occurred on his way to and from the place where it was committed.

Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order to corroborate his evidence as to the robbery itself.

**157. Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact**. In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness relating to the same fact, at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.

**158. What matters may be proved in connection with proved statement relevant under Section 32 or 33**. Whenever any statement, relevant under Section 32 or 33, is proved, all matters may be proved, either in order to contradict or to corroborate it, or in order to impeach or confirm the credit of the person by whom it was made, which might have been proved if that person had been called as a witness and had denied upon cross-examination the truth of the matter suggested.

**159. Refreshing memory**. A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory.

The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person, and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if when he read it he knew it to be correct.

**When witness may use copy of document to refresh memory**. Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he may, with the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of such document:

Provided the Court be satisfied that there is sufficient reason for the non-production of the original.

An expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatises.

## **160. Testimony to facts stated in document mentioned in Section 159**.

A witness may also testify to facts mentioned in any such document as is mentioned in Section 159, although he has no specific recollection of the facts themselves, if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document.

Illustration

A book-keeper may testify to facts recorded by him in books regularly kept in the course of business, if he knows that the books were correctly kept, although he has forgotten the particular transactions entered.

## [^182]**161. Right of adverse party as to writing used to refresh memory**.

Any writing referred to under the provisions of the two last preceding sections must be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires it; such party may, if he pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon.

## **162. Production of documents**.

A witness summoned to produce a document shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to the Court, notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its production or to its admissibility. The validity of any such objection shall be decided on by the Court.

The Court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document, unless it refers to matters of State, or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility.

**Translation of documents**. If for such a purpose it is necessary to cause any document to be translated, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret, unless the document is to be given in evidence: and, if the interpreter disobeys such direction, he shall be held to have committed an offence under Section 166 of the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860).

## **163. Giving, as evidence, of document called for and produced on notice**.

When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to produce, and such document is produced and inspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it requires him to do so.

## **164. Using, as evidence, of document, production of which was refused on notice**.

When a party refuses to produce a document which he has had notice to produce, he cannot afterwards use the document as evidence without the consent of the other party or the order of the Court.

Illustration

_A_ sues _B_ on an agreement and gives _B_ notice to produce it. At the trial, _A_ calls for the document and _B_ refuses to produce it. _A_ gives secondary evidence of its contents. _B_ seeks to produce the document itself to contradict the secondary evidence given by _A_, or in order to show that the agreement is not stamped. He cannot do so.

## **165. Judge's power to put questions or order production**.

The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question:

Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Act to be relevant, and duly proved:

Provided also that this section shall not authorize any Judge to compel any witness to answer any question, or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under Sections 121 to 131, both inclusive, if the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under Section 148 or 149; nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of any document, except in the cases hereinbefore excepted.

## **166. Power of jury or assessors to put questions**.

In cases tried by jury or with assessors, the jury or assessors may put any questions to the witnesses, through or by leave of the Judge, which the Judge himself might put and which he considers proper.

# Chapter XI OF IMPROPER ADMISSION AND REJECTION OF EVIDENCE

## **167. No new trial for improper admission or rejection of evidence**.

The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case, if it shall appear to the Court before which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision.
