# Criminal Procedure Code, 1973

ACT NO. 2 OF 1974

01 January, 1976

An Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to Criminal Procedure

Be it enacted by Parliament in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows:

#### **statement of objects and reasons**

(1) The law relating to criminal procedure applicable to all criminal proceedings in India (except those in the States of Jammu & Kashmir and Nagaland and the tribal areas in Assam) is contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The Code has been amended from time to time by various Acts of the Central and State Legislatures. The more important of these were the amendments brought about by Central Legislation in 1923 and 1955. The amendments of 1955 were extensive and were intended to simplify procedures and speed up trials as far as possible. In addition, local amendments were made by State Legislatures, of which the most important were those made to bring about separation of the Judiciary from the Executive. Apart from these amendments, the provisions of the Code of 1898 have remained practically unchanged through these decades and no attempt was made to have a comprehensive revision of this old Code till the Central Law Commission was set up in 1955.

(2) The First Law Commission presented its Report (the Fourteenth Report) on the Reform of Judicial Administration, both civil and criminal, in 1958; it was not concerned with detailed scrutiny of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but it did make some recommendations in regard to the law of criminal procedure, some of which required amendments to the Code. A systematic examination of the Code was subsequently undertaken by the Law Commission not only for giving concrete form to the recommendations made in the Fourteenth Report but also with the object of attempting a general revision. The main task of the Commission was to suggest measures to remove anomalies and ambiguities brought to light by conflicting decisions of the High Courts or otherwise, to consider local variations with a view to securing and maintaining uniformity, to consolidate laws wherever possible and to suggest improvements where necessary. Suggestions for improvements received from various sources were considered by the Commissions. A comprehensive report for the revision of the Code, namely, the Forty-first Report, was presented by the Law Commission in September, 1969. This report took into consideration the recommendations made in the earlier Reports of the Commission dealing with specific matters namely, the Fourteenth, Twenty-fifth, Thirty-second, Thirty-third, Thirty-sixth, Thirty-seventh and Fortieth Reports.

(3) The recommendations of the Commission were examined carefully by the Government, keeping in view, among others, the following basic considerations

(*i*) an accused person should get a fair trial in accordance with the accepted principles of natural justice;

(*ii*) every effort should be made to avoid delay in investigation and trial which is harmful not only to individuals involved but also to society; and

(*iii*) the procedure should not be complicated and should, to the utmost extent possible, ensure fair deal to the poorer sections of the community.

The occasion has been availed of to consider and adopt where appropriate suggestions received from other quarters, based on practical experience of investigation and the working of criminal courts.

(4) One of the main recommendations of the Commission is to provide for the separation of the Judiciary from the Executive on an all-India basis in order to achieve uniformity in this matter. To secure this, the Bill seeks to provide for a new set-up of criminal courts. In addition to ensuring fair deal to the accused, separation as provided for in the Bill would ensure improvement in the quality and speed of disposal, as all Judicial Magistrates would be legally qualified and trained persons working under close supervision of the High Court.

(5) Some of the more important changes proposed to be made with a view to speeding up the disposal of criminal cases are

(*a*) the preliminary inquiry which precedes the trial by a Court of Session, otherwise known as committal proceedings, is being abolished as it does not serve any useful purpose and has been the cause of considerable delay in the trial of offences;

(*b*) provision is being made to enable adoption of the summons procedure for the trial of offences punishable with imprisonment up to two years instead of up to one year as at present; this would enable a larger number of cases being disposed of expeditiously;

(*c*) the scope of summary trials is being widened by including offences punishable with imprisonment up to one year instead of six months as at present; summons procedure will be adopted for all summary trials;

(*d*) the powers of revision against interlocutory orders are being taken away, as it has been found to be one of the main contributing factors in the delay of disposal of criminal cases;

(*e*) the provision for compulsory stoppage of proceedings by a subordinate court on the mere intimation from a party of his intention to move a higher court for transfer of the case is being omitted and a further provision is being made to the effect that the court hearing the transfer application shall not stay proceedings unless it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice;

(*f*) when adjournments are granted at the instance of either party, the court is being empowered to order costs to be paid by the party obtaining the adjournment to the other party;

(*g*) provision is being made for the service of summons by registered post in certain cases;

(*h*) in petty cases, the accused is being enabled to plead guilty by post and to remit the fine specified in the summons;

(*i*) if a court of appeal or revision discovers that any error, omission or irregularity in respect of a charge has occasioned failure of justice, it need not necessarily order retrial;

(*j*) the facility of part-heard cases being continued by successors in office now available in respect of Courts of Magistrates is being extended to Courts of Session.

In addition to the above specific measures, the Commission's recommendations which are intended to resolve conflicts of decisions on various matters or to remove ambiguities have been given effect to and these provisions may, by themselves, help in reducing the time taken in litigation.

(6) Some of the more important changes intended to provide relief to the poorer sections of the community are

(*a*) provisions have been made for giving legal aid to an indigent accused in cases triable by a Court of Session; the State Governments may extend this facility to other categories of cases;

(*b*) the court has been empowered to order payment of compensation by the accused to the victims of crimes, to a larger extent than is now permissible under the Code;

(*c*) when a commission is issued for the examination of a witness for the prosecution, the cost incurred by the defence including pleader's fees may be ordered to be paid by the prosecution;

(*d*) the accused will be given an opportunity to make representation against the punishment before it is imposed.

In addition to these specific provisions, the steps taken to reduce delays would themselves automatically benefit the poorer sections, as it is they who particularly suffer by the prolongation of criminal cases.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 45 of 1978**

The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 came into force on the 1st day of April, 1974. The working of the new Code has been carefully watched and in the light of the experience, it has been found necessary to make a few changes for removing certain difficulties and doubts.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 63 of 1980**

With a view to enabling the law enforcement agencies to deal effectively with anti-social elements, habitual criminals and those creating enmity between different groups and communities, the President promulgated on 23rd September, 1980 the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Ordinance, 1980. The Ordinance, inter alia, sought to:

(*i*) amend the provisions regarding bail so as to make it more difficult for habitual criminals committing serious offences to obtain bail;

(*ii*) provide for civil imprisonment of surety for failure of the accused to appear in the court so as to curb the practice of giving bail by professional sureties;

(*iii*) confer on the District Magistrates also power to accord sanction for prosecution under Section 153-B and sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 505 of the Indian Penal Code;

(*iv*) vest the power to take security proceedings under Sections 108, 109 and 110 of the Code in Executive Magistrates; and

(*v*) provide for transfer of the power to take security proceedings under the aforementioned Sections 108, 109 and 110 of the Code to Judicial Magistrates.

\2. The Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 32 of 1988**

Agreements with foreign countries in regard to mutual assistance in criminal matters could be entered into on the basis of reciprocity. Co-operation with the law enforcement agencies of foreign countries in regard to locating witnesses, obtaining information about persons who are under investigation and investigation of crime not involving the exercise of any measure to compel any person to answer questions, etc., can be secured by the provisions of agreements. It is, however felt that the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the Code) should contain appropriate provisions for taking evidence of witnesses or production of documents using compulsory measures.

\2. Sub-section (3) of Section 285 and clause (*b*) of sub-section (2) of Section 290 of the Code incorporate the principle of reciprocity in regard to taking of evidence of witnesses on commission in India and in a foreign country. However, Section 105 of the Code relating to reciprocal arrangements regarding processes (which inter alia contain provision for production of documents) does not at present enable a Court in India to issue summons or warrant to be served or executed outside India, or vice versa. It has, therefore, been found necessary to amend Section 105 of the Code.

\3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 10 of 1990**

The investigating authorities in India were handicapped in collecting evidence, available in a foreign country or place, in respect of a crime committed by a citizen of India outside the country, due to the absence of a specific provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Hence an Ordinance was promulgated on the 19th February, 1990 to amend the Code for the purpose.

\2. A new Section 166-A had been inserted in the Code to enable the investigating authorities and the Criminal Courts to issue letter of request to their counterparts in foreign countries to collect evidence and transmit the same to the authority or Court issuing such letter. Every evidence so collected shall be deemed to be evidence collected during the course of investigation.

\3. Having regard to the principle of reciprocity, another section, namely, Section 166-B, had also been inserted in the Code for facilitating letters of request to be sent by foreign investigating agencies or Courts to their counterparts in India for similar purposes.

\4. The Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 43 of 1991**

Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides for the previous sanction of the Central Government or, as the case may be, the State Government before a court took cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed by any public servant including a Judge, Magistrate and member of the Forces while acting in the discharge of official duty.

\2. With a view to providing more adequate safeguards and protection to public servants employed in connection with the affairs of a State against frivolous or vexatious prosecution for acts done in the discharge of official duty during the period when a Proclamation issued under Article 356 of the Constitution was in force in that State, it was considered necessary to provide for the previous sanction, of the Central Government instead of the sanction of the State Government.

\3. In view of the above, an Ordinance was promulgated on the 2nd May, 1991 to amend Section 197 of the said Code.

\4. The Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 40 of 1993**

The Government of India had signed an agreement with the Government of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for extending assistance in the investigation and prosecution of crime and the tracing restraint and confiscation of the proceeds of crime (including crimes involving currency transfers) and terrorist funds with a view to check the terrorist activities in India and the United Kingdom. For giving full effect to this agreement, it is proposed to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to provide for

(*a*) the transfer of persons between the contracting States including persons in custody for the purpose of assisting in investigation or giving evidence in proceedings;

(*b*) attachment and forfeiture of properties obtained or derived from the commission of an offence that may have been or has been committed in the other country; and

(*c*) enforcement of attachment and forfeiture orders issued by a court in the other country.

\2. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 50 of 2001**

It has been observed that an applicant, after filing application in a court under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, has to wait for several years for getting relief from the Court. It is, therefore, felt that express provisions should be made in the said Code for interim maintenance allowance to the aggrieved person under said Section 125 of the Code. Accordingly, it is proposed that during the pendency of the proceedings, the Magistrate may order payment of interim maintenance allowance and such expenses of the proceedings as the Magistrate consider reasonable, to the aggrieved person. It is also proposed that this order be made ordinarily within sixty days from the date of the service of the notice.

\2. The ceiling of rupees five hundred per month for maintenance allowance was prescribed in the year 1955 in Section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. A ceiling of rupees five hundred was prescribed in Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on the lines of Section 488 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 which has since been repealed. In view of the cost of living index constantly rising retention of a maximum ceiling is not justified. If a ceiling is prescribed and retained, it would require periodic revision taking into account the inflation and rise in the cost of living as well as amendment of provisions of the Act from time to time. This would necessarily be time consuming. Accordingly, it is also proposed to amend Section 125 and make consequential changes in Section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to remove the ceiling of maintenance allowance.

\3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 5 of 2009**

The need to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to ensure fair and speedy justice and to tone up the criminal justice system has been felt for quite sometime. The Law Commission has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Code of Criminal Procedure in its 154th report and its recommendations have been found very appropriate, particularly those relating to provisions concerning arrest, custody and remand, procedure for summons and warrant-cases, compounding of offences, victimology, special protection in respect of women and inquiry and trial of persons of unsound mind. Also, as per the Law Commission's 177th report relating to arrest, it has been found necessary to revise the law to maintain a balance between the liberty of the citizens and the society's interest in maintenance of peace as well as law and order.

\2. The need has also been felt to include measures for preventing the growing tendency of witnesses being induced or threatened to turn hostile by the accused parties who are influential, rich and powerful. At present, the victims are the worst sufferers in a crime and they don't have much role in the court proceedings. They need to be given certain rights and compensation, so that there is no distortion of the criminal justice system. The application of technology in investigation, inquiry and trial is expected to reduce delays, help in gathering credible evidences, minimise the risk of escape of the remand prisoners during transit and also facilitate utilisation of police personnel for other duties. There is an urgent need to provide relief to women, particularly victims of sexual offences, and provide fair trial to persons of unsound mind who are not able to defend themselves. To expedite the trial of minor offences, definition of warrant-case and summons-case are to be changed so that more cases can be disposed of in a summary manner.

\3. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2006 seeks to achieve the above objectives.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 41 of 2010**

In the light of objections from certain quarters to certain provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2008, the said Act could not be brought into force.These provisions, inter alia, relate to the power of the police to arrest without warrant. A reference in the matter was made to the Law Commission of India to take the initiative to bring about a consensus on the issues. The Law Commission discussed the issues with all concerned including the Chairperson(s) of some of the Bar Councils and the Chairman of the Bar Council of India. After holding consultations, the Law Commission recommended further amendment in the provisions of amended Section 41 of the aforesaid Act to make it compulsory for the police to record the reasons for making an arrest as well for not making an arrest in respect of a cognizable offence for which the maximum punishment is up to seven years. The Law Commission also suggested further changes in the newly inserted Section 41-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 1973 (inserted by Act 5 of 2009) to make it compulsory for the police to issue a notice in all such cases where arrest is not required to be made under clause (*b*) of sub-section (1) of the amended Section 41. It was also suggested that the unwillingness of a person who has not been arrested to identify himself and to whom a notice has been issued under the aforesaid Section 41-A could be a ground for his arrest. It has been decided to accept the suggestions of the Law Commission of India and to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 1973, as amended by the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2008.

\2. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

#### **statement of objects and reasons of amendment act 22 of 2018**

Recent incidents of rape and gang rape on women under the age of sixteen years and twelve years have shaken the conscience of the entire Nation. Therefore, the offences of rape and gang rape on women under the age of sixteen years and twelve years required effective deterrence through legal provisions of more stringent punishment. Some of the incidents in recent years have been marked by increased brutality and violence perpetrated on minor girls. This has fueled demands from various sections of the society to make the penal provisions more stringent and effective, immediate arrest of the accused and ensure speedy trial in such cases.

\2. As the Parliament was not in session and immediate action was required to be taken in this regard to make necessary amendments in the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, the President promulgated the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 on 21st April, 2018.

\3. It is, therefore, proposed to introduce the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2018 to replace the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018, which, inter alia, provides for

(*a*) punishment for the offence of rape from the minimum imprisonment of seven years to ten years, which is extendable to imprisonment for life;

(*b*) punishment for the offence of rape on a woman under sixteen years of age shall be rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than twenty years but may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life and shall also be liable to fine;

(*c*) punishment for the offence of rape on a woman under twelve years of age shall be rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than twenty years but may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life and with fine or with death;

(*d*) punishment for the offence of gang rape on a woman under sixteen years of age shall be imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life and with fine;

(*e*) punishment for the offence of gang rape on a woman under twelve years of age shall be imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life and with fine or with death;

(*f*) investigation in relation to all rape cases shall be completed within a period of two months from the date on which the information recorded by the officer- in-charge of the police station;

(*g*) completion of inquiry or trial relating to the offence of rape, within a period of two months;

(*h*) dispose of an appeal against a conviction or a cquittal in rape cases within a period of six months from the date of filing of the appeal;

(*i*) the provisions of anticipatory bail shall not be applicable in cases of rape or gang rape of woman under sixteen and twelve years of age;

(*j*) consequential amendments in the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 relating to the cases of rape, gang rape of the woman below the age of sixteen years, twelve years, repeat offenders, to extend the applicability of compulsory registration of FIRs, fine imposed to be paid to victim, facilitate better recording of evidence and protect the dignity of rape survivor and treatment free of cost in hospitals.

\4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.

# Chapter XV

# COMPLAINTS TO MAGISTRATES 

## Section 200. Examination of complainant 

A Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint shall examine upon oath the complainant and the witnesses present, if any, and the substance of such examination shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the complainant and the witnesses, and also by the Magistrate:

Provided that, when the complaint is made in writing, the Magistrate need not examine the complainant and the witnesses

(*a*) if a public servant acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duties or a court has made the complaint; or

(*b*) if the Magistrate makes over the case for inquiry or trial to another Magistrate under Section 192:

Provided further that if the Magistrate makes over the case to another Magistrate under Section 192 after examining the complainant and the witnesses, the latter Magistrate need not re-examine them.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 200 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 201. Procedure by Magistrate not competent to take cognizance of the case

**Corresponding Law:** S. 201 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 202. Postponement of issue of process 

(1) Any Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he is authorized to take cognizance or which has been made over to him under Section 192, may, if he thinks fit, [132](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_132)[and shall, in a case where the accused is residing at a place beyond the area in which he exercises his jurisdiction,] postpone the issue of process against the accused, and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding:

Provided that no such direction for investigation shall be made,

(*a*) where it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable exclusively by the Court of Session; or

(*b*) where the complaint has not been made by a Court, unless the complainant and the witnesses present (if any) have been examined on oath under Section 200.

(2) In an inquiry under sub-section (1), the Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, take evidence of witnesses on oath:

Provided that if it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, he shall call upon the complainant to produce all his witnesses and examine them on oath.

(3) If an investigation under sub-section (1) is made by a person not being a police officer, he shall have for that investigation all the powers conferred by this Code on an officer in charge of a police station except the power to arrest without warrant.

**Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment** False complaints are filed against persons residing at far off places simply to harass them. In order to see that innocent persons are not harassed by unscrupulous persons, this clause seeks to amend sub-section (1) of Section 202 to make it obligatory upon the Magistrate that before summoning the accused residing beyond his jurisdiction he shall enquire into the case himself or direct investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit, for finding out whether or not there was sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 202 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 203. Dismissal of complaint 

If, after considering the statements on oath (if any) of the complainant and of the witnesses and the result of the inquiry or investigation (if any) under Section 202, the Magistrate is of opinion that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding, he shall dismiss the complaint, and in every such case he shall briefly record his reasons for so doing.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 203 of Act V of 1898.

## Chapter XVI COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE MAGISTRATES 

## Section 204. Issue of process 

(1) If in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence there is sufficient ground for proceeding, and the case appears to be

(*a*) a summons-case, he shall issue his summons for the attendance of the accused, or

(*b*) a warrant-case, he may issue a warrant, or, if he thinks fit, a summons, for causing the accused to be brought or to appear at a certain time before such Magistrate or (if he has no jurisdiction himself) some other Magistrate having jurisdiction.

(2) No summons or warrant shall be issued against the accused under sub-section (1) *until a list of the prosecution witnesses has been filed.*

(3) In a proceeding instituted upon a complaint made in writing, every summons or warrant issued under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied by a copy of such complaint.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 204 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 205. Magistrate may dispense with personal attendance of accused

(2) But the Magistrate inquiring into or trying the case may, in his discretion, at any stage of the proceedings, direct the personal attendance of the accused, and, if necessary, enforce such attendance in the manner hereinbefore provided.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 205 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 206. Special summons in case of petty offence 

(1) If, in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of a petty offence, the case may be summarily disposed of under Section 260 [133](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_133)[or Section 261], the Magistrate shall, except where he is, for reasons to be recorded in writing of a contrary opinion, issue summons to the accused requiring him either to appear in person or by pleader before the Magistrate on a specified date, or if he desires to plead guilty to the charge without appearing before the Magistrate, to transmit before the specified date, by post or by messenger to the Magistrate, the said plea in writing and the amount of fine specified in the summons or if he desires to appear by pleader and to plead guilty to the charge through such pleader, to authorize, in writing, the pleader to plead guilty to the charge on his behalf and to pay the fine through such pleader:

Provided that the amount of the fine specified in such summons shall not exceed [134](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_134)[**one thousand rupees**].

(2) For the purposes of this section, petty offence means any offence punishable only with fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (4 of 1939), or under any other law which provides for convicting the accused person in his absence on a plea of guilty.

[135](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_135)[(3) The State Government may, by notification, specially empower any Magistrate to exercise the powers conferred by sub-section (1) in relation to any offence which is compoundable under Section 320 or any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or with fine, or with both where the Magistrate is of opinion that, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the imposition of fine only would meet the ends of justice.]

**Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment** The provisions of Section 206 are meant to enable a quick disposal of petty cases and to reduce congestion in the Court of Magistrates. Since the value of the money has gone down considerably, this clause seeks to amend sub-section (1) of that section to raise the limit of fine that can be specified in the summons from one hundred rupees to one thousand rupees. 

## Section 207. Supply to the accused of copy of police report and other documents 

In any case *where the proceeding has been instituted on a **police report***, the Magistrate shall without delay furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following:

(*i*) the police report;

Provided further that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any document referred to in clause (*v*) is voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only be allowed to inspect it either personally or through pleader in Court. 

## Section 208. Supply of copies of statements and documents to accused in other cases triable by Court of Session 

Where, *in a case instituted **otherwise than on a police report***, it appears to the Magistrate issuing process under Section 204 that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, the Magistrate shall without delay furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following:

(*i*) the statements recorded under Section 200 or Section 202, of all persons examined by the Magistrate;

(*ii*) the statements and confessions, if any, recorded under Section 161 or Section 164;

Provided that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any such document is voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only be allowed to inspect it either personally or through pleader in Court. 

## Section 209. Commitment of case to Court of Session when offence is triable exclusively by it 

When in a case instituted on a police report or otherwise, the accused appears or is brought before the Magistrate and it appears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, he shall

[136](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_136)[(*a*) commit, after complying with the provisions of Section 207 or Section 208, as the case may be, the case to the Court of Session, and subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand the accused to custody until such commitment has been made];

(*b*) subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand the accused to custody during, and until the conclusion of, the trial;

(*b*) subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand the accused to custody until commitment of the case under clause (*a*) and thereafter during, and until the conclusion of trial; . U.P. Act 16 of 1976, S. 6. 

## Section 210. Procedure to be followed when there is a complaint case and police investigation in respect of the same offence 

(1) When in a case instituted otherwise than on a police report (hereinafter referred to as a **complaint case)**, it is made to appear to the Magistrate, during the course of the inquiry or trial held by him, that an investigation by the police is in progress in relation to the offence which is the subject-matter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall ***stay the proceedings** of such inquiry or trial and call for a report on the matter from the police officer conducting the investigation.*

(2) If a report is made by the investigating police officer under Section 173 and on such report cognizance of any offence is taken by the Magistrate against any person who is an accused in the complaint case, the Magistrate shall inquire into or try together the complaint case and the case arising out of the police report as if both the cases were instituted on a police report.

(3) If the police report does not relate to any accused in the complaint case or if the Magistrate does not take cognizance of any offence on the police report, he shall proceed with the inquiry or trial, which was stayed by him, in accordance with the provisions of this Code.

# THE CHARGE

## A. *Form of Charges* 

## Section 211. Contents of charge 

(1) Every charge under this Code shall **state the offence** with which the accused is charged.

(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any **specific name**, the offence may be described in the charge by that name only.

(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the **definition of the offence** must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.

(4) The **law and section** of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be mentioned in the charge.

(5) The fact that the charge is made is **equivalent to a statement** that every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.

(6) The charge shall be written in the **language** of the Court.

(7) If the accused, having been **previously convicted** of any offence, is liable, by reason of such previous conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent offence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed.

**Illustrations**

(*a*) *A* is charged with the murder of *B*. This is equivalent to a statement that *A*'s act fell within the definition of murder given in Sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions of the said Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to Section 300, or that, if it did fall within Exception 1, one or other of the three provisos to that exception applied to it.

(*b*) *A* is charged under Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to *B* by means of an instrument for shooting.

(*c*) *A* is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark. The charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or that he used a false property-mark, without reference to the definition of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), but the sections under which the offence is punishable must in each instance be referred to in the charge.

(*d*) *A* is charged under Section 184 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) with intentionally obstructing a sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words.

(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money or other movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, describe the movable property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of Section 219:

Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed **one year.**

**Corresponding Law:** S. 222 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 213. When manner of committing offence must be stated 

When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in Sections 211 and 212 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also *contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose.*

**Illustrations**

(*a*) *A* is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in which the theft was effected.

(*b*) *A* is accused of cheating *B* at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which *A* cheated *B*.

(*c*) *A* is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The charge must set out that portion of the evidence given by *A* which is alleged to be false.

(*d*) *A* is accused of obstructing *B*, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which *A* obstructed *B* in the discharge of his functions.

(*e*) *A* is accused of the murder of *B* at a given time and place. The charge need not state the manner in which *A* murdered *B*.

(*f*) *A* is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save *B* from punishment. The charge must set out the disobedience charged and the law infringed.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 223 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 214. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable 

In every charge words used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense attached to them respectively by the law under which such offence is punishable.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 224 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 215. Effect of errors 

**No error** in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, and **no omission** to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any stage of the case *as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice.*

**Illustrations**

(*a*) *A* is charged under Section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with having been in possession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit , the word fraudulently being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that *A* was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not be regarded as material.

(*b*) *A* is charged with cheating *B*, and the manner in which he cheated *B* is not set out in the charge, or is set out incorrectly. *A* defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.

(*c*) *A* is charged with cheating *B*, and the manner in which he cheated *B* is not set out in the charge. There were many transactions between *A* and *B*, and *A* had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error.

(*d*) *A* is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was 20th January, 1882. *A* was never charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that *A* was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.

(*e*) *A* was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from this that *A* was misled, and that the error was material.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 225 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 216. Court may alter charge 

(1) Any Court may **alter or add** to any charge at any time before judgment is pronounced.

(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 227 of Act V of 1898.

(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is **not likely,** in the opinion of the Court, **to prejudice** the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 228 of Act V of 1898.

(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial **is likely**, in the opinion of the Court, **to prejudice** the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 229 of Act V of 1898.

(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 230 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 217. Recall of witnesses when charge altered 

Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed

(*a*) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice;

(*b*) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 231 of Act V of 1898.

B. *Joinder of Charges* 

## Section 218. Separate charges for distinct offences 

(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately:

Provided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is of opinion that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or any number of the charges framed against such person.

(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall affect the operation of the provisions of Sections 219, 220, 221 and 223.

Illustration

*A* is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion. *A* must be separately charged and separately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt.

## Section 219. Three offences of same kind within year may be charged together 

(1) When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three.

(2) Offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with the same amount of punishment under the same section of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local laws:

Provided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence punishable under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an offence punishable under Section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under any section of the said Code, or of any special or local law, shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit such offence, when such an attempt is an offence.

**Corresponding Law:** S. 234 of Act V of 1898. 

## Section 220. Trial for more than one offence 

(1) If, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence.

(2) When a person charged with one or more offences of criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of property as provided in sub-section (2) of Section 212 or in sub-section (1) of Section 219, is accused of committing, for the purpose of facilitating or concealing the commission of that offence or those offences, one or more offences of falsification of accounts, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence.

(3) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, the person accused of them may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences.

(4) If several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute when combined a different offence, the person accused of them may be charged with, and tried at one trial for the offence constituted by such acts when combined, and for any offence constituted by any one, or more, of such acts.

(5) Nothing contained in this section shall affect Section 71 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).

[178](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_178)[(1-A) If the civil surgeon finds the accused to be of unsound mind, he shall refer such person to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist for care, treatment and prognosis of the condition and the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, as the case may be, shall inform the Magistrate whether the accused is suffering from unsoundness of mind or mental retardation:

Provided that if the accused is aggrieved by the information given by the psychiatric or clinical psychologist, as the case may be, to the Magistrate, he may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist of

Provided that if the Magistrate finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused in respect of whom a finding of unsoundness of mind is arrived at, he shall postpone the proceeding for such period, as in the opinion of the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, is required for the treatment of the accused, and order the accused to be dealt with as provided under Section 330.

(4) If such Magistrate is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (1-A) is a person with mental retardation, the Magistrate shall further determine whether the mental retardation renders the accused incapable of entering defence, and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate shall order closure of the inquiry and deal with the accused in the manner provided under Section 330.]

[181](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_181)[(2) If such Magistrate or Court is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (1-A) is a person of unsound mind, the Magistrate or Court shall further determine whether unsoundness of mind renders the accused incapable of entering defence and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate or Court shall record a finding to that effect and shall examine the record of evidence produced by the prosecution and after hearing the advocate of the accused but without questioning the accused, if the Magistrate or Court finds that no prima facie case is made out against the accused, he or it shall, instead of postponing the trial, discharge the accused and deal with him in the manner provided under Section 330:

(2) If the case is one in which, in the opinion of the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, bail cannot be granted or if an appropriate undertaking is not given, he or it shall order the accused to be kept in such a place where regular psychiatric treatment can be provided, and shall report the action taken to the State Government:

Provided that no order for the detention of the accused in a lunatic asylum shall be made otherwise than in accordance with such rules as the State Government may have made under the Mental Health Act, 1987 (14 of 1987).

Provided that

(*a*) if on the basis of medical opinion or opinion of a specialist, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, decide to order discharge of the accused, as provided under Section 328 or Section 329, such release may be ordered, if sufficient security is given that the accused shall be prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person;

(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub-section (2), the State Government may, in any case of conviction on a trial held by any Court other than a High Court, direct the Public Prosecutor to present [197](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_197)[an appeal against the sentence on the ground of its inadequacy

(*a*) to the Court of Session, if the sentence is passed by the Magistrate; and

(*b*) to the High Court, if the sentence is passed by any other Court.]

(2) If such conviction is in a case in which the offence has been investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment, constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946), or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than this Code, the Central Government may [198](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_198)[also] direct the Public Prosecutor to present [199](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_199)[an appeal against the sentence on the ground of its inadequacy

(*a*) to the Court of Session, if the sentence is passed by the Magistrate; and

(*b*) to the High Court, if the sentence is passed by any other Court.]

(3) When an appeal has been filed against the sentence on the ground of its inadequacy, [200](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_200)[the Court of session or, as the case may be,] the High Court shall not enhance the sentence except after giving to the accused a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against such enhancement and while showing cause, the accused may plead for his acquittal or for the reduction of the sentence.

[201](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_201)[(4) When an appeal has been filed against a sentence passed under Section 376, Section 376-A, Section 376-AB, Section 376-B, Section 376-C, Section 376-D, Section 376-DA, Section 376-DB or Section 376-E of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the appeal shall be disposed of within a period of six months from the date of filing of such appeal.]

**Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment** Section 377 is being amended so as to permit the filing of an appeal in the Court of Session instead of the High Court on the ground of inadequacy of sentence passed by a Magistrate. This amendment is intended not only to make it easier for the administration to prefer appeals against unduly lenient sentences by Magistrates but will also deter the latter from passing sentence that are grossly inadequate. 

## Section 378. Appeal in case of acquittal 

[202](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_202)[(1) Save as otherwise provided in sub-section (2), and subject to the provisions of sub-sections (3) and (5),

(*a*) the District Magistrate may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the Court of Session from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence;

(*b*) the State Government may, in any case, direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from an original or appellate order of an acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court [not being an order under clause (*a*)] or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision.]

(2) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case in which the offence has been investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment constituted under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (25 of 1946) or by any other agency empowered to make investigation into an offence under any Central Act other than this Code, [203](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_203)[the Central Government may, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), also direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal

(*a*) to the Court of Session, from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence;

(*b*) to the High Court from an original or appellate order of an acquittal passed by any Court other than a High Court [not being an order under clause (*a*)] or an order of acquittal passed by the Court of Session in revision.]

(4) If such an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon complaint and the High Court, on an application made to it by the complainant in this behalf, grants special leave to appeal from the order of acquittal, the complainant may present such an appeal to the High Court.

(5) No application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of six months, where the complainant is a public servant, and sixty days in every other case, computed from the date of that order of acquittal.

(6) If in any case, the application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal is refused, no appeal from that order of acquittal shall lie under sub-section (1) or under sub-section (2).

**Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment** In order to guard against the arbitrary exercise of power and to reduce reckless acquittals, Section 378 is being amended to provide that an appeal against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence filed on a police report would lie to the Court of Sessions, and the District Magistrate will be authorised to direct the Public Prosecutor to file such appeals. In respect of all other cases filed on a police report, on appeal against an order of acquittal passed by any court other than the High Court should lie only to the High Court and the authority to direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal shall continue to be with the State Government.

Chapter XXXIII

PROVISIONS AS TO BAIL AND BONDS 

## Section 436. In what cases bail to be taken 

(1) When any person other than a person accused of a non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station, or appears or is brought before a Court, and is prepared at any time while in the custody of such officer or at any stage of the proceeding before such Court to give bail, such person shall be released on bail:

Provided that such officer or Court, if he or it thinks fit, may, [210](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_210)[and shall, if such person is indigent and is unable to furnish surety] instead of taking bail from such person, discharge him on his executing a bond without sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided.

[211](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_211)[*Explanation*. Where a person is unable to give bail within a week of the date of his arrest, it shall be a sufficient ground for the officer or the Court to presume that he is an indigent person for the purposes of this proviso:]

Provided further that nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 116 [212](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_212)[or Section 446-A].

(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), where a person has failed to comply with the conditions of the bail-bond as regards the time and place of attendance, the Court may refuse to release him on bail, when on a subsequent occasion in the same case he appears before the Court or is brought in custody and any such refusal shall be without prejudice to the powers of the Court to call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the penalty thereof under Section 446.

**Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment** In respect of bailable offences, a person has to remain in jail for his inability to furnish bail, till the case is disposed of. Section 436(1) is, therefore, being amended to make a mandatory provision that if the arrested person is accused of a bailable offence and he is an indigent and cannot furnish surety, the Court shall release him on his execution of a bond without sureties.

Where a person has, during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial under this Code of an offence under any law (not being an offence for which the punishment of death has been specified as one of the punishments under that law) undergone detention for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence under that law, he shall be released by the Court on his personal bond with or without sureties:

Provided that the Court may, after hearing the Public Prosecutor and for reasons to be recorded by it in writing, order the continued detention of such person for a period longer than one-half of the said period or release him on bail instead of the personal bond with or without sureties:

Provided further that no such person shall in any case be detained during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial for more than the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the said offence under that law.

*Explanation*. In computing the period of detention under this section for granting bail, the period of detention passed due to delay in proceeding caused by the accused shall be excluded.]

**Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment** There had been instances, where undertrail prisoners were detained in jail for periods beyond the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the alleged offence. A new Section 436-A is being inserted in the Code to provide that where an undertrial prisoner other than the one accused of an offence for which death has been prescribed as one of the punishments, has been under detention for a period extending to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the alleged offence, he should be released on his personal bond, with or without sureties.

It is also proposed to provide that in no case will an undertrial prisoner be detained beyond the maximum period of imprisonment for which he can be convicted for the alleged offence. 

## Section 437. When bail may be taken in case of non-bailable offence 

[214](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_214)[(1) When any person accused of, or suspected of, the commission of any non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer-in-charge of a police station or appears or is brought before a Court other than the High Court or Court of Session, he may be released on bail, but

(*i*) such person shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life;

(*ii*) such person shall not be so released if such offence is a cognizable offence and he had been previously convicted of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for seven years or more, or he had been previously convicted on two or more occasions of [215](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_215)[a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for three years or more but not less than seven years]:

Provided that the Court may direct that a person referred to in clause (*i*) or clause (*ii*) be released on bail if such person is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman or is sick or infirm:

Provided further that the Court may also direct that a person referred to in clause (*ii*) be released on bail if it is satisfied that it is just and proper so to do for any other special reason:

Provided also that the mere fact that an accused person may be required for being identified by witnesses during investigation shall not be sufficient ground for refusing to grant bail if he is otherwise entitled to be released on bail and gives an undertaking that he shall comply with such directions as may be given by the Court:]

[216](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_216)[Provided also that no person shall, if the offence alleged to have been committed by him is punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or more, be released on bail by the Court under this sub-section without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Public Prosecutor.]

(2) If it appears to such officer or Court at any stage of the investigation, inquiry or trial, as the case may be, that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed a non-bailable offence, but that there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt, [217](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_217)[the accused shall, subject to the provisions of Section 446-A and pending such inquiry, be released on bail], or, at the discretion of such officer or Court, on the execution by him of a bond without sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided.

(3) When a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or of an offence under Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abetment of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offence, is released on bail under sub-section (1), the [218](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_218)[the Court shall impose the conditions,

(*a*) that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter,

(*b*) that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, or suspected, of the commission of which he is suspected, and

(*c*) that such person shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer or tamper with the evidence,

and may also impose, in the interests of justice, such other conditions as it considers necessary.]

(4) An officer or a Court releasing any person on bail under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), shall record in writing his or its [219](https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979daf4a93263ca60b7265#note_219)[reasons or special reasons] for so doing.

(5) Any Court which has released a person on bail under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), may, if it considers it necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested and commit him to custody.

(6) If, in any case triable by a Magistrate, the trial of a person accused of any non-bailable offence is not concluded within a period of sixty days from the first date fixed for taking evidence in the case, such person shall, if he is in custody during the whole of the said period, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, unless for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise directs.

(7) If, at any time after the conclusion of the trial of a person accused of a non-bailable offence and before judgment is delivered, the Court is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of any such offence, it shall release the accused, if he is in custody, on the execution by him of a bond without sureties for his appearance to hear judgment delivered.

**Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment** This clause seeks to amend Section 437 to provide that if a person commits a cognizable and non-bailable offence and he has previously been convicted on two or more occasions of a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for 3 years or more but not less than 7 years, he shall not be released except in the circumstances specified in the provision.

It is further provided that if an accused appears before the Court while in judicial custody and prays for bail, or a prayer for bail is made on his behalf, the Court shall grant bail only after giving an opportunity of hearing to the prosecution, if the offence alleged to have been committed by the accused is punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for not less than 7 years.

Under sub-section (3) of Section 437 of the Code, the Court has got the discretion to impose certain conditions for the grant of bail. Under Section 441(2), where any condition is imposed for the release of a person on bail, the bond shall contain that condition also. In order to make the provision stringent and to see that the person on bail does not interfere or intimidate witness, sub-section (3) is being amended to specify certain conditions, which are mandatory.

Notes on Clauses to 2005 Amendment

Entries relating to Sections 153-AA, 174-A and 229-A to be inserted in the Indian Penal Code, as indicated in clause 54 have to be incorporated in the First Schedule to the Code. The amendments are consequential.

The offence under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code, *i.e.*, voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means is at present bailable. Since the offender is immediately released on bail, the chances of recovering the weapon of offence are remote; therefore, the First Schedule appended to the Code, is being amended to classify the offence as non-bailable.

The offences under Section 274 (Adulteration of drugs), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging his duty) of the Indian Penal Code are at present bailable. In order to deal with these offences effectively, the First Schedule to the Code is being amended to classify offences under Section 274, 332 and 353 of the Indian Penal Code as non-bailable.
