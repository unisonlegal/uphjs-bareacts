## Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972

U P ACT 013 OF 1972

08 March, 1972

An Act to provide, in the interest of the general public, for the regulation of letting and rent of, and the eviction of tenants from, certain classes of buildings situated in urban areas, and for matters connected therewith

It is hereby enacted in the Twenty-third Year of the Republic of India as follows:

**Prefatory Note Statement of Objects and Reasons**. The United Provinces (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947, was passed as a temporary Act, with a view mainly to continuing in force provisions relating to control or letting and rent of accommodation similar to those contained in orders which had been issued under the Defence of India Rules, 1939. It was expected that the situation of shortage of accommodation would be tided over after a short period, and accordingly an Ordinance was promulgated in 1946, and it was replaced by a temporary Act in 1947. In view, however, of the continuing increase in the urban population and the relatively slow pace of house-building activity, mainly, due to shortage of materials the problem of shortage of accommodation has become chronic, and the life of the Act has had to be extended from time to time. Various amendments were also made in its provisions as and when problems arose. Some of the provisions attracted criticism on various grounds in Courts of law and also criticism by informed public opinion. Government gave an assurance to the Legislature that they would soon replace the Act by a new comprehensive legislation, and accordingly, this Bill has been prepared.

The salient features of the Bill are as follows:

(1) It is proposed to make the new law a permanent one instead of a temporary measure.

(2) Instead of fixing a particular date and applying the law only to buildings constructed till the date it is proposed that the new law shall apply to all buildings after a period of 10 years from the date of completion of their construction. Thus the number of buildings that will be brought under regulation shall be rising progressively as time passes. Ten-year holiday from regulation is being provided to give incentive for construction of new buildings.

(3) Under Section 3 of the Old Act the powers of the District Magistrate in the matter of grant of permission for instituting a suit for eviction of a tenant were not defined and he had an unfettered discretion to allow eviction on any ground whatsoever. The grounds on which such eviction of a sitting tenant may be permitted or release of a vacant building allowed, have now been restricted. Further in order to reduce multiplicity of proceedings and also to reduce the congestion in civil courts it has been provided that proceedings for eviction shall lie before the prescribed authority instead of in the civil court.

(4) The provision for revision to the State Government against allotment and release orders and orders of eviction of unauthorised occupants has been omitted. Instead, appeals against allotment orders and orders of release of vacant buildings that may be passed by the District Magistrate or his delegate shall lie to the Commissioner and appeals against orders of the District Magistrate or his delegate determining or refixing rent and orders of the prescribed authority in release proceedings against sitting tenants shall lie to the District Judge, and the decision of the Commissioner or the District Judge, shall be final.

(5) Suits for eviction on the grounds specified in Section 3 of the old Act which lay in the Court of Munsif or Civil Judge, shall now lie in the Courts of Small Causes. This will do away with the multiplicity of appeals, as only a revision will lie against the decision of the Small Cause Court as in other small cause cases. Further, out of the grounds specified in the old Act, some have been modified. As it appear that allegations of causing a nuisance were sometimes made for creating a fictitious ground of eviction, this ground has been omitted. Moreover, mere making of material alterations will not be a valid ground of eviction and only structural alterations in the building will form such ground.

(6) Buildings held by educational institutions or charitable societies or buildings built and held by co-operative societies, companies and firms for their own occupation or for the occupation of their employees, etc. shall be exempt from the operation of the new law.

(7) Certain provisions have been made with a view to ensuring that buildings are not deliberately got under-assessed, and the local authorities get their due share of taxes according to the correct letting value. Re-fixation of rent on the application of the tenant is also being provided for in such cases.

(8) Suits for eviction pending against tenants of buildings brought under regulation for the first time shall not be decreed and decrees for eviction already obtained shall not be executed except on specified grounds.

(9) After the death of tenant the surviving members of his family shall be entitled to the same protection as the deceased.

(10) In the case of such repairs, as are essential to keep a building wind-proof and water-proof the tenant is being allowed to deduct two months' rent instead of one month's rent.

(11) The tenant's liability to pay enhanced house tax is being reduced from one-third of the amount of enhancement to one-fourth thereof.

(12) The provisions regarding allotment, maintenance of the building in wind-proof and water-proof condition and of amenities attached to it, and deposit of rent in Court in certain circumstances have been retained, and certain loopholes in the various provisions have been sought to be plugged.

This Bill is, accordingly, introduced.
